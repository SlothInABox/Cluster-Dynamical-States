"""simulation file

This module uses parameter data for assorted galaxy clusters to simulate
clusters at various timesteps. The data can be analysed to determine whether a
cluster is relaxed or unrelaxed. The timescale for a galaxy to go from relaxed
to unrelaxed can then be determined.

To do:
    *Import data from 'dat' folder
    *Create graphs of parameters for test cluster (zero redshift)
